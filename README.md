# Drone-Image-Classification-using-CNN-Imagenet-models-
This is deep learning image classification model. I have classified dataset using imagent's different classification models. I have taken the imagenet models and finetuned them to fit my dataset. changed first layer accordingly our dataset and given proper parameters to train deep learning neural network model. <br>

In this dataset their are total 5 categories of images. using ResNet152V2 model has shown 96.96% trainig accuracy and 87.86% of validation accuracy. In Resnet.ipynb file complete training code is given after traing use prediction.ipynb file to predict images using saved pretrained model.
